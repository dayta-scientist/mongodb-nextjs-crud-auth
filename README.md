A full-stack web application was created using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB as the database. A REST API was developed, and graphical interfaces were created using components. The application was styled using Tailwind CSS. Users are authenticated using credentials such as email and password through NextAuth, which uses JWT and cookies. The backend API is connected to MongoDB using Mongoose and bcrypt.
